# hello_world
first git repo

Hello all,

Trying to learn about git so I can use it for Windows/Linux development at my company.  Been using source code managers for 30 years on the mainframe and CVS for the last 16 on Windows.  Lin/Win development switched to git a few years ago but kept on supporting CVS mainly for the two items that I work with.  The person who pushed git was not very forthcoming when I asked about making the switch so now I'm doing OJT trying to get up to speed and using any tool I can to help!.
